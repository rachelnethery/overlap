# overlap

This is the code to conduct the simulations and data analysis in the paper "Estimating Population Average Causal Effects in the Presence of Non-Overlap: The Effect of Natural Gas Compressor Station Exposure on Cancer Mortality". The folder simulations_main provides code to conduct the simulations in Section 3 of the main manuscript. The folder simulation_supp provides code to conduct the simulations in Section 2 of the Supplementary Materials. The folder natgas_analysis contains code and data to reproduce the data analysis in Section 4 of the main manuscript. Each simulation requires the user-specified command line arguments shown at the head of the file.
