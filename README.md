# overlap

This is the code to conduct the simulations in Section 3 of the paper Estimating Population Average Causal Effects in the Presence of Non-Overlap: A Bayesian Approach. Filenames starting with "sim" are the files that run the simulations from each of the four sub-sections. Each simulation requires the user-specified command line arguments shown at the head of the file. The simulation output is stored in the specified working directory.
